● Difference between a Library and Framework?
it can be visualised using a house metaphor

A Framework is a like a house, you have a blueprint and limited choices when it comes to architecture and design

In technical terms it can be called as inversion of control
when you use the liberary you are incharge of the flow of the application. you are injecting liberary code to the project
whereas in Framework, it is incharge of the flow. It allows you to place the code in flow, but it calls the flow.

in Normal flow: HMTL parsing is going on -> then paused -> script is fectched from server -> script is Executed -> HTML parsing resumes
in async flow : HMTL parsing is going on -> script is fectched from server -> HTML parsing paused -> script is Executed -> HTML parsing resumes
in defer flow : HMTL parsing is going on -> script is fectched from server -> script is Executed => HTML parsing never pauses
